This is a clone of a classic distortion guitar pedal circuit that has been designed to be used with K7TFC's all discrete LM741 op-amp.

This circuit has not been tested, so I do not suggest trying to build it without looking at it first. 3 prototype boards are currently being fabricated. 

This is also my first KiCad project and as a builder, I am completely unexperienced as a circuit drafter/designer. 

A huge thanks to K7TFC/Mostly DIY RF for their incredibly inspirational work on the OA741D.
